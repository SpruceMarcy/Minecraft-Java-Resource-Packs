# Minecraft Java Resource Packs
 
Hello! This is Marcy's collection of resource packs for Minecraft Java Edition! Beneath this paragraph is a quick overview of all the packs in this collection, as well as their dependencies.
Currently, these packs are all successfully updated to version `1.18.2`

## (Optional) Monster Spawning Highlights
This alters the light level rendering to highlight all spots where monsters can spawn in red. Since 1.18, monsters can only spawn in light level 0, so this pack makes all spots with light level 0 a red hue.

>Requires: Optifine  
>Resolution: N/A  
>Tips: Turn smooth lighting off for the best experience.

## Firework Durations 32x32
This pack adds a subtle number to the body of a firework indicating the fuse length (or, how many pieces of gunpowder were used to craft it). This only applies to fireworks without a firework star.

>Requires: Optifine  
>Resolution: 32x32

## Gay Jammie Dodgers 32x32
This pack is an odd fusion of two aesthetic choices. Firstly, it turns the XP bar into a set of small pride flags. Secondly, it turns cookies into Jammie Dodgers (name included), as well as turning cocoa beans into strawberries to make the recipe make sense. This pack was made to celebrate Jammie Dodgers becoming vegan, like the in-game recipe for cookies.

>Requires: N/A  
>Resolution: 32x32

## Improved Chickens 16x16 Leghorn Edition
This pack updates the chicken model to much more accurately represent real life chickens. No more ducks! This edition in particular resembles Leghorns, which is presumably what the vanilla chickens are designed after.

## Improved Chickens 32x32 Leghorn Edition
This pack updates the chicken model to much more accurately represent real life chickens. No more ducks! This edition in particular resembles Leghorns, which is presumably what the vanilla chickens are designed after.
